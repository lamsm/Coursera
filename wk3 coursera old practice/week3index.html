	<h2>Week 3: Giving it more "body"</h2>
	<div style="text-align: left;"> <p> During my third week, I began to get more experience with understanding the jargon, finding more information on Google and comfortably (and more importantly <i>efficiently</i>) designing on my own as I strayed away from the Coursera course. If you check out the link and dig around, you'll see that the course uses a restaurant website as a project, taking us through its design from start-to-finish. Of course what you're seeing right now doesn't suit that purpose and so as I neared the end of this week's course content, I began to add my own little touch to things. The current website you are looking at right now is the cumulation of this week's presented knowledge and skills. A lot of it was designed with a bit of humor and playfulness (notice the memes in the header, phone number and 
	"Where's Waldo" images.)
