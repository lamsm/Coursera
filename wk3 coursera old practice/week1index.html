	<h2>Week 1: Starting Out</h2>
	<div style="text-align: left;"> <p>The first few hours I spent on learning web design prioritized familiarizing myself with the jargon encountered in this industry. This helped me become familiar with the goals, uses, processes and other aspects of webpage development; most importantly, I was able to find the resources and applications necessary to set-up the development environment. </p>
	<p> To be honest, this initial "set-up" part was likely the most frustrating, slow and crappy part of this self-motivated online learning process. I probably could have picked a more beginner-friendly resource or book. However, given that I have come so far without spending any money (aside from my coffee shop allowance), I think it worked out alright. I believe this type of career (hobby, interest, dabbling in my case) presents this challenge as a trial of sorts. If you are unable to figure things out on your own, or know where to look for answers, then succeeding in an web-dev, software-dev --any technology-related field might be something to come back to later... </p>
	<p> Back to the start: putting it in simple terms, my learning process was as follows: </p>
		<ol> 
			<li> Learning the jargon:
				<p> Each and every market, industry, profession and field has their own vocabulary. Unfortunately, my background is in biology and education, with a splash of statistics. Similar to learning about what's under the hood of your car, the usages and applications of various make-up products, or the game mechanics of a popular videogame, each of these situations require a level of commitment, prior research, a guide, examples and many other resources. </p> </li>
			<li> Setting up a "development environment":
				<p> We need certain tools to get the job done. Imagine the process of changing your tires: Where do you start? What tools 
					do you need to succeed? Why are you changing your tires? What would be the best brand, tread and size of tires you'd need? We need to consider many variables and scenarios as we work. In our case, we are looking for the tools that will help us develop a website. I have included a link to the Coursera course in the header (top of the page). I have yet to understand the tools that I am using, hopefully that comes soon (Note: the coding part gets easier as you work through things, I will detail it more in one of my future entries). </p>
				<p> Some tools: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Chrome Developer Tools
								<p> Helps us troubleshoot/analyze webpages during our journey. </p>
							</li>
							<li>Github.com and Git
								<p> Helps us keep a record of our progress. The
								simplest analogy I can make is that these two work as our filing cabinet and system. </p>
							</li>
							<li>Sublime Text 3
								<p> This is our code editor, chalkboard or piece of paper. We do our work on here. </p>
							</li>
							<li>NodeJs and BrowserSync
								<p> Sublime Text 3, our code editor, allows us to write down (code) what we want. However, it doesn't show us the results of our code. It's like writing a cooking recipe without doing the cooking. NodeJs helps us install Browsersync. BrowserSync allows the computer to cook up the recipe as we're writing it, which will help us see what our code does and what it looks like. 
								</p>
							</li> 
						</ul>
				<p style="font-style: italic;"> Note: As someone with no experience or formal training in the field, this is as far as I'm able to understand and describe some things. Please excuse me if I'm totally off-the-mark about something. On the other hand, I hope that this is useful for other struggling students foreign to the field. I am hoping to turn difficult concepts and jargon into more easily digestible chunks of English.</p> </li>
			<li> Resourcing and Troubleshooting: 
				<p>One of the largest problems with knowledge is that oftentimes we figure out that it's out-of-date, not quite true or something else just as inconvenient.</p>
				<p>The Coursera course I have been following is 4-to-5 years out of date, hence the finding out the tools and parts necessary to follow along was a huge pain-in-the-ass. You can imagine it as using a manual for the 2008 model of your car to fix your 2021 model (I recently damaged my car, so there will be plenty of car analogies). As a result, troubleshooting and finding the correct resources felt like a wild goose chase. Eventually, I was able to find the correct manual (version of Bootstrap) and continue on with my learning.</p>
			</li>
			<li> Get started (or resume getting started comfortably):
				<p> After following along with the first few lessons, as well as learning how to navigate the jargon (specifically "css classes") and read the manual (outlined on the Bootstrap website). Things seem pretty smooth sailing. I am writing this retroactively, and as of right now, will be continuing on from Week 3/4 of the Coursera course. </p>
			</li>
			</ol>	
	<p>That is as far as I am right now, I hope this entry provided a little bit of insight or at least some relief knowing that someone else out there has also suffered some frustratation.</p>
